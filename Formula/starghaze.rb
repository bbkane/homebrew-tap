          The darwin_arm64 architecture is not supported for the Starghaze
          formula at this time. The darwin_amd64 binary may work in compatibility
          mode, but it might not be fully supported.

    Unfortunately, Apple wants to charge developers $100/year to distribute
    their apps without a big scary "... the developer cannot be verified"
    warning. I'm not willing to pay that to give away free apps.
    See https://www.macworld.com/article/3140183/how-to-install-an-app-in-macos-sierra-thats-not-signed-by-a-developer.html to work around that
